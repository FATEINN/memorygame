#Memory Game

In my Fend Udacity course, I had to create a memory game where upon clicked, two cards match and stay open. Once all cards are matched, a pop up message appears and congratulates the user for winning the game. The pop up gives a score from 1 to 3, how much time it took, and how many moves it took to finish the game. 


## Installing from Source

1. Clone the following repository: 
  * git clone https://github.com/FATEINN/memorygame.git

2. open index.html in browser.

3. Play the game

## How to Play:

##Click *https://fateinn.github.io/memorygame/ to play the game.

* The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.

1. Start by clicking on two cards, if they match, look for another pair of cards. If cards are not a pair, try again.

2. Keep matching up pairs until all cards are matched and faced up. 

3. Congratulations, you win! An alert window appears tell you your score, time, and moves it took to complete the game. If there is an issue with a single card randomly paired, just hit the restart button on the top right corner of the game. 

4. On the Alert window, you can hit 'Go Again!' to have another go at the game, keep playing for the best score and brag off to your friends.
